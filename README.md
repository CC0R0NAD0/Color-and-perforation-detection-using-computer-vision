# Color-and-perforation-detection-using-computer-vision
Development of an application to detect perforations and color of cards through of computer vision with a phone camera.

Below are the results of a project focused on the area of computer vision, which corresponds to
to the elaboration of a program that receives as input an image of a flat monochrome background, on which it is placed
one paper card at a time, these cards come in 8 different colors as well as 6 grayscale values, each card features
from 0 to 5 perforations, for which the objectives of this project correspond to determine if it is chromatic
or achromatic (Chromatological analysis), as well as detecting the presence of perforations and indicating the missing ones (Detection of
edges).
This project is implemented with Python in Google Colab, by Carlos Coronado Zúñiga and Adrián Monge Barahona,
Technological Institute of Costa Rica, Costa Rica.
